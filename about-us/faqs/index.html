	 	<h2 class="a-left">Is Outdoor Education right for us?</h2>
	 	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	 	<h4 class="a-left">For students</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">Studies show that young people who do outdoor education improve their happiness and get better results. They meet new people in a beautiful environment which facilitates friendship, and will be pushed to be their best selves.

	 	It's also fun! Our programs give young people a chance to stretch their legs, try their hand at something new, and create fond memories associated with your organisation.<br>&nbsp;</p>
	 	<h4 class="a-left">For parents</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">We recognise that sending a child on an outdoor education program can be a stressful experience for any parent. That's why we work hard to meet parents before a trip, provide useful information about planning for your child's program, and streamline the medical and emergency contact process.

	 	During their program, your child will be in confident, safe, qualified hands at MOE, with lots of support on standby to make sure everything runs smoothly. If anything happens, our team is ready to respond, and notify you in a professional and timely manner.<br>&nbsp;</p>
	 	<h4 class="a-left">For your organisation</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">Outdoor education is quickly becoming an essential part of young people's development. It teaches those skills which you can't learn as effectively in a classroom, and which many young people are not seeking out themselves.

	 	Commissioning a MOE program for your young people will give them a competitive advantage in their futures, and a memorable, impactful experience in the present.<br>&nbsp;</p>

	 	<h2 class="a-left">Commissioning a program</h2>
	 	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	 	<h4 class="a-left">How far in advance do we need to book?</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">In order to perform appropriate risk assessment, logistics management, and staffing, we typically take bookings 6-12 months in advance of the desired program dates. Depending on the desired program outline, the required lead up might be shorter or longer.<br>&nbsp;</p>
	 	<h4 class="a-left">How much is it likely to cost?</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">We advise that for typical programs, we generally charge between $100-$200 per participant per day. However, due to the custom nature of our programs, we are unable to give a perfect ballpark of program price, and this price can be higher or lower dependant on the complexity of your desired program. Our promise, is to work with you to deliver timely, accurate, and transparent quotes as relevant to your outline.<br>&nbsp;</p>
	 	<h4 class="a-left">When am I committed?</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">Initially, we engage you with a discussion about what you need with no obligations. If we can't meet your needs, we won't be upset if you decide we're not for you.
	 	There is no commitment until you sign a program contract, although as planning becomes more serious, we may take a 10% deposit on your quoted figure, to be deducted off your final bill.<br>&nbsp;</p>
	 	<h4 class="a-left">What's involved in commissioning?</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">We begin to talk with you, to get to know your organisation, your risk tolerances, your expectations, and desired outcomes. From this, we'll begin drawing up a program outline, which will typically see a few revisions prior to being finalised. The finalised program will be costed, and finally a contract produced. This process typically takes between two to four weeks.<br>&nbsp;</p>

	 	<h2 class="a-left">Preparing for your program</h2>
	 	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	 	<h4 class="a-left">What is involved in the planning stage?</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">In the planning stage, we begin to onboard your staff, young people, and parents.
	 	We typically send a MOE staff to a pre-trip meeting at your location, so your young people and their parents can ask questions, and learn more about their program should they wish. This meeting will be accompanied with emails, letters, and calls.
	 	We'll also prepare any staff you're sending for the trip, and help you set up all the necessary logistics, medical forms, and transport needed from your organisation.<br>&nbsp;</p>
	 	<h4 class="a-left">What does the program cost cover?</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">Our programs are custom made, so coverage is dependant on your needs. Typically, program costs cover all your food, accommodation, leaders, and activities, as well as most outdoor specific equipment and transport from a pickup/drop-off location of your choice.<br>&nbsp;</p>
	 	<h4 class="a-left">What equipment is provided?</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">We provide all activity specific (climbing, camping, etc.) equipment, and all risk management equipment as standard. Additional equipment can be attained for your ease at extra cost. We'll always be clear about equipment that your young people and staff will need to bring themselves.<br>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4 class="a-left">Food allergies, dietary requirements, and medicals</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">We can cater for (almost) everyone, but we will need all your participants food allergy, and dietary requirements at least four weeks prior to your program starting. During this time, we will also attain your participants medical information.<br>&nbsp;</p>

	 	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	 	<h4 class="a-left">What is needed from our organisation?</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">We require clients to have an All Hours Contact that can be reached by MOE in event of an emergency or external query. Typically, clients will also bring their own staff to complement ours on a program, and include a familiar face in group leadership. We'll work with you to establish what they are responsible for on trips, and accommodate any specific needs.<br>&nbsp;</p>
	 	<h4 class="a-left">When would a program be ended early?</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">Every effort gets made to run a program despite weather, environmental, and group conditions, but if any variable creates too much risk, we will end the program early. In this event, we will find an alternative activity, wait until the group can resume their program, or return participants to the drop off early.<br>&nbsp;</p>
	 	<h4 class="a-left">What happens if a serious incident occurs?</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">We have a strong support network, extensive incident response plans, and adequate insurance for all our programs. If something does happen, a dedicated incident team tasked with ensuring the best possible outcome will be assigned to your group, and you'll be notified in a timely and straight-forward manner.<br>&nbsp;</p>

	 	<h4 class="a-left">What if we want to rebook?</h4>
	 	<p class="a-left">Once your current contract expires, we can rebook you for your desired dates should you choose to, and discuss creating a sequence program for your organisation.<br>&nbsp;</p>
